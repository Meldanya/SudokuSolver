# Sudoku Solver EDAA01

This is my (now quite old) solution to the Sudoku solver assignment in
the course EDAA01 at LTH.

## Please don't copy this code and hand in as your solution

I've already been contacted by an associate professor at LTH who told me
that this has happened. When plagiarism or cheating is discovered,
employees at the University are *required by law* to report the offender
to the disciplinary committee at the University. The committee can give
you a warning or suspend you for up to six months (and notify CSN about
the suspension, cancelling the payments for the duration of the
suspension).

You're also not doing yourself any favours. Trust me, if you already
feel the need to cheat during this course, you will have a very
difficult time in later courses (hint: the courses aren't getting any
easier later on).
